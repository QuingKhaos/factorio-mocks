# GitHub Milestones Strategy for Factorio Mocks Ecosystem

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended milestone strategy for tracking progress across the Factorio Mocks Ecosystem
development phases.

## Milestone Structure

### Phase-Based Milestones (Recommended)

Use milestones to track major phase completion rather than version releases:

#### Milestone 1: Foundation Complete

**Phase Goal**: Establish complete project infrastructure and planning foundation for ecosystem development

**Community Value**: Provides clear project direction, contribution pathways, and development infrastructure
that enables community participation from day one

**Key Deliverables**:

- [ ] All 5 repositories created with proper structure and documentation
- [ ] Complete planning documentation published and accessible
- [ ] Community contribution processes established (templates, workflows, guidelines)
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows operational for quality assurance
- [ ] ADR process functional for architectural decisions
- [ ] Community validation checkpoint - feedback on project direction and approach

**Success Metrics**: Community can understand project goals, contribute effectively, and development
infrastructure supports quality contributions

**Dependencies**: None - this is the foundational phase

#### Milestone 2: Generator Prototype

**Phase Goal**: Deliver working proof-of-concept for Factorio data extraction and serialization

**Community Value**: Enables early experimentation with mock data generation, validates core technical approach,
and provides concrete examples for community feedback

**Key Deliverables**:

- [ ] `factorio-mocks-generator` extracts basic Factorio game data
- [ ] Proof-of-concept data serialization working with JSON output
- [ ] Basic CLI interface for generator usage
- [ ] Documentation for generator installation and usage
- [ ] First community testing feedback incorporated
- [ ] Community validation checkpoint - technical approach validation

**Success Metrics**: Community members can generate basic mock data and provide meaningful feedback
on the approach and output quality

**Dependencies**: Foundation Complete milestone must be finished

#### Milestone 3: Ecosystem Integration

**Phase Goal**: Connect all ecosystem components with end-to-end data flow working

**Community Value**: Delivers complete workflow from data generation to consumption, enabling real mod
testing scenarios and comprehensive ecosystem validation

**Key Deliverables**:

- [ ] ORAS artifact distribution working with GitHub Container Registry
- [ ] `factorio-mocks-loader` can consume generated data artifacts
- [ ] `factorio-mocks-modpacks` provides curated mod combinations
- [ ] End-to-end testing workflow established and documented
- [ ] Cross-repository coordination and versioning working
- [ ] Community validation checkpoint - complete workflow testing

**Success Metrics**: Community can generate, distribute, and consume mock data for real mod testing scenarios

**Dependencies**: Generator Prototype milestone must be finished

#### Milestone 4: Community Ready

**Phase Goal**: Production-ready ecosystem optimized for widespread community adoption

**Community Value**: Provides polished, performant, and well-documented tooling that supports diverse
community use cases and scales to broader adoption

**Key Deliverables**:

- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and tutorials for all use cases
- [ ] Multiple modpack configurations available for different scenarios
- [ ] Performance optimized for common use cases and large mod sets
- [ ] Community feedback incorporated from integration testing
- [ ] Production deployment guides and best practices
- [ ] Community validation checkpoint - production readiness assessment

**Success Metrics**: Ecosystem supports diverse community needs efficiently and is ready for public announcement

**Dependencies**: Ecosystem Integration milestone must be finished

### Version-Based Milestones (Future Use)

After initial ecosystem is established, switch to version milestones:

#### Milestone: v1.0.0 Release

**Phase Goal**: Deliver first stable, production-ready release with API stability guarantees and comprehensive
ecosystem maturity

**Community Value**: Provides stable foundation for long-term mod development workflows, with reliable APIs and
guaranteed backward compatibility that teams can depend on for production use

**Key Deliverables**:

- [ ] API stability commitments made with semantic versioning policy
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage across all ecosystem components
- [ ] Production deployment guide with best practices and troubleshooting
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimization for large-scale usage
- [ ] Breaking change migration guides and tooling
- [ ] Community adoption metrics met (usage statistics, feedback quality)
- [ ] Security audit and vulnerability assessment completed
- [ ] Long-term maintenance and support strategy documented
- [ ] Community validation checkpoint - production readiness verification

**Success Metrics**: Ecosystem is stable enough for production use by mod development teams, with clear upgrade
paths and reliable performance at scale

**Dependencies**: Community Ready milestone must be finished, plus sufficient real-world usage and feedback

## Milestone Management Best Practices

### Assignment Strategy

- Assign issues to milestones during triage
- Use milestones to group related work across repositories
- Review milestone progress in monthly planning meetings

### Progress Tracking

- Use milestone progress bars to visualize completion
- Review and adjust milestone scope based on community feedback
- Document milestone retrospectives for future planning

### Cross-Repository Coordination

- Create matching milestones across all 5 repositories
- Use ecosystem labels to track cross-repo dependencies
- Coordinate milestone releases across repositories

## Alternative: Hybrid Approach

### **Short-Term**: Phase Milestones

- Use phase-based milestones during initial development
- Focus on architectural and planning completion
- Track community engagement and validation

### **Long-Term**: Version Milestones

- Switch to semantic versioning once stable releases begin
- Use version milestones for feature releases and bug fixes
- Maintain separate versioning for each repository component

## Recommended GitHub Setup

### Current Milestones to Create

1. **Foundation Complete**
2. **Generator Prototype**
3. **Ecosystem Integration**
4. **Community Ready**

### Milestone Description Template

```markdown
**Phase Goal**: [Brief description of what this phase achieves]

**Community Value**: [What value does completing this phase deliver?]

**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2
- [ ] Community validation checkpoint

**Success Metrics**: [How do we know this phase is complete?]

**Dependencies**: [What must be completed first?]
```

## Benefits of Phase-Based Milestones

### For Planning Projects

- **Clear Progress Indicators**: Each phase has concrete deliverables
- **Community Engagement**: Phases align with community value delivery
- **Flexible Scope**: Can adjust timeline based on feedback without "version" confusion
- **Cross-Repo Coordination**: Single milestone can span multiple repositories

### For Contributors

- **Clear Expectations**: Contributors understand what "done" looks like
- **Progress Visibility**: Community can see ecosystem-wide progress
- **Contribution Targeting**: Can focus efforts on current phase priorities

### For Maintainers

- **Release Planning**: Natural breakpoints for community updates
- **Scope Management**: Clear boundaries for what belongs in each phase
- **Quality Gates**: Each milestone requires community validation

## When to Switch to Version Milestones

**Switch when**:

- First functional release is ready
- API stability becomes important
- Regular release cadence is established
- Community adoption reaches critical mass

**Indicators**:

- Multiple external projects using the ecosystem
- Breaking changes need careful management
- Feature requests exceed architectural changes
- Bug reports from production usage

This phase-based milestone approach aligns with your iterative, community-first development philosophy while
providing clear progress tracking and coordination across the ecosystem.
