### Version-Based Milestones (Future Use)

After initial ecosystem is established, switch to version milestones:

#### Milestone: v1.0.0 Release

**Phase Goal**: Deliver first stable, production-ready release with API stability guarantees and comprehensive
ecosystem maturity

**Community Value**: Provides stable foundation for long-term mod development workflows, with reliable APIs and
guaranteed backward compatibility that teams can depend on for production use

**Key Deliverables**:

- [ ] API stability commitments made with semantic versioning policy
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage across all ecosystem components

- [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimization for large-scale usage
- [ ] Breaking change migration guides and tooling
- [ ] Community adoption metrics met (usage statistics, feedback quality)
- [ ] Security audit and vulnerability assessment completed
- [ ] Long-term maintenance and support strategy documented
- [ ] Community validation checkpoint - production readiness verification

**Success Metrics**: Ecosystem is stable enough for production use by mod development teams, with clear upgrade
paths and reliable performance at scale

**Dependencies**: Community Ready milestone must be finished, plus sufficient real-world usage and feedback

## Milestone Management Best Practices

### Assignment Strategy

- Assign issues to milestones during triage
- Use milestones to group related work across repositories
- Review milestone progress in monthly planning meetings

### Progress Tracking

- Use milestone progress bars to visualize completion
- Review and adjust milestone scope based on community feedback
- Document milestone retrospectives for future planning

### Cross-Repository Coordination

- Create matching milestones across all 5 repositories
- Use ecosystem labels to track cross-repo dependencies
- Coordinate milestone releases across repositories

## Alternative: Hybrid Approach

### **Short-Term**: Phase Milestones

- Use phase-based milestones during initial development
- Focus on architectural and planning completion
- Track community engagement and validation

### **Long-Term**: Version Milestones

- Switch to semantic versioning once stable releases begin
- Use version milestones for feature releases and bug fixes
- Maintain separate versioning for each repository component

## Recommended GitHub Setup

### Current Milestones to Create

1. **Foundation Complete**
2. **Modpack Support and Data Repository**
3. **Advanced Loader Functionality**
4. **Community Ready**

### Milestone Description Template

```markdown
**Phase Goal**: [Brief description of what this phase achieves]

**Community Value**: [What value does completing this phase deliver?]

**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2
- [ ] Community validation checkpoint

**Success Metrics**: [How do we know this phase is complete?]

**Dependencies**: [What must be completed first?]
```

## Benefits of Phase-Based Milestones

### For Planning Projects

- **Clear Progress Indicators**: Each phase has concrete deliverables
- **Community Engagement**: Phases align with community value delivery
- **Flexible Scope**: Can adjust timeline based on feedback without "version" confusion
- **Cross-Repo Coordination**: Single milestone can span multiple repositories

### For Contributors

- **Clear Expectations**: Contributors understand what "done" looks like
- **Progress Visibility**: Community can see ecosystem-wide progress
- **Contribution Targeting**: Can focus efforts on current phase priorities

### For Maintainers

- **Release Planning**: Natural breakpoints for community updates
- **Scope Management**: Clear boundaries for what belongs in each phase
- **Quality Gates**: Each milestone requires community validation

## When to Switch to Version Milestones

**Switch when**:

- First functional release is ready
- API stability becomes important
- Regular release cadence is established
- Community adoption reaches critical mass

**Indicators**:

- Multiple external projects using the ecosystem
- Breaking changes need careful management
- Feature requests exceed architectural changes
- Bug reports from production usage
