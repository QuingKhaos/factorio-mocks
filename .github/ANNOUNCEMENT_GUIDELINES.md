## GitHub Copilot Integration

### During Development Sessions

**GitHub Copilot will proactively suggest announcements when:**

- Major milestones are completed during our work sessions
- Significant architectural decisions are finalized
- Repository infrastructure reaches stable states
- Documentation or tooling becomes community-ready
- Breaking changes are implemented

**Suggested workflow:**

1. Copilot identifies announcement opportunity
2. Suggests appropriate template and timing
3. Helps draft announcement content
4. Recommends which discussion categories to post in

### Copilot Cannot

- Monitor repository activity between sessions
- Automatically detect external contributions or issues
- Set up automated announcement triggers
- Track community engagement metrics independently

### Manual Triggers to Consider

Set personal reminders for:

- Monthly progress updates (first of each month)
- Milestone reviews (when phases complete)
- Community metric checks (weekly contributor/issue counts)
- Breaking change advance notices (2+ weeks before implementation)

*These guidelines help maintain consistent, valuable communication with the Factorio Mocks community while celebrating
progress and keeping everyone informed.*
