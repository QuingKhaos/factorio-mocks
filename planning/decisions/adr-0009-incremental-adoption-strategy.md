# ADR-0009: Incremental Adoption Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Factorio Mocks Ecosystem needs to maximize adoption while the full ecosystem is being developed. The approach must
balance providing immediate value to the community against the complexity of maintaining multiple integration paths
and ensuring a smooth user experience during the development and rollout phases.

## Decision

Design ecosystem for incremental adoption rather than all-or-nothing approach, enabling developers to adopt individual
components and progress through different levels of functionality as the ecosystem matures.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **POS-001**: Early value delivery provides immediate benefit to community during ongoing development phases
- **POS-002**: Feedback loop enables real-world feedback collection to guide development priorities and decisions
- **POS-003**: Reduced risk through lower barrier to initial adoption and gradual user commitment
- **POS-004**: Community building grows user base gradually with proven value delivery at each stage
- **POS-005**: Iteration opportunity allows adjustment based on actual usage patterns and user needs

### Negative

- **NEG-001**: Complexity overhead maintaining multiple integration paths and compatibility layers
- **NEG-002**: Documentation burden supporting different adoption levels with appropriate guidance
- **NEG-003**: Support complexity handling users at different ecosystem adoption stages

## Alternatives Considered

### Complete Solution First

- **ALT-001**: **Description**: Build entire ecosystem before any public releases or community access
- **ALT-002**: **Rejection Reason**: Delays community value delivery and eliminates feedback opportunities during
  development

### Monolithic Releases

- **ALT-003**: **Description**: Release complete functionality in large increments with major version updates
- **ALT-004**: **Rejection Reason**: Higher adoption barriers and reduced feedback frequency for iterative improvement

## Implementation Notes

- **IMP-001**: Component independence ensures each repository provides standalone value proposition
- **IMP-002**: Clear migration paths enable easy progression from basic to advanced usage scenarios
- **IMP-003**: Backward compatibility maintained as ecosystem evolves with clear deprecation policies
- **IMP-004**: Documentation tiers provide different levels of information for various adoption stages
