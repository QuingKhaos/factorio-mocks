# ADR-0011: Community-First Development Model

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Factorio Mocks Ecosystem success depends on active community engagement and ensuring the solution meets real
community needs rather than theoretical requirements. The development approach must balance transparency, community
involvement, technical excellence, and sustainable development practices.

## Decision

Prioritize community involvement and transparency throughout development with public planning, RFC processes, regular
updates, and clear contribution pathways.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **POS-001**: Community buy-in achieved through stakeholder involvement in design decisions and priority setting
- **POS-002**: Real-world validation ensures designs tested against actual use cases and requirements
- **POS-003**: Shared ownership builds community investment in ecosystem success and long-term sustainability
- **POS-004**: Knowledge transfer through documented decisions enables future contributors and maintainers
- **POS-005**: Quality feedback from experienced Factorio modders improves architecture and implementation decisions

### Negative

- **NEG-001**: Development pace may be slower due to community consultation and consensus building requirements
- **NEG-002**: Decision complexity increased with multiple stakeholders and varying priorities to balance
- **NEG-003**: Communication overhead requires ongoing documentation and community engagement maintenance

## Alternatives Considered

### Closed Development

- **ALT-001**: **Description**: Internal development with community involvement only after major milestones
- **ALT-002**: **Rejection Reason**: Risk of building solution that doesn't meet actual community needs and reduces
  adoption

### Expert-Driven Development

- **ALT-003**: **Description**: Small core team makes all decisions with minimal external input
- **ALT-004**: **Rejection Reason**: May miss important use cases and reduces community ownership and contribution

## Implementation Notes

- **IMP-001**: Public planning with comprehensive documentation of all architectural decisions and rationale
- **IMP-002**: RFC process enables community input on major changes with structured feedback collection
- **IMP-003**: Regular communication through blog posts, updates, and community calls maintains engagement
- **IMP-004**: Clear contribution guidelines provide structured ways for community involvement at all skill levels
